Flags Understood on build.sh

-i  Interactive Mode, for each target distribution/arch it drops you directly to a bash prompt. You can run influx builder at that time under mnt/builds/

-d Distributions, each distribution specified is seperated by a space for example ./build.sh -d centos fedora

-a Architecture, this flag is currently not used as we only target AMD64
